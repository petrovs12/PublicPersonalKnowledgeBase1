[Visualization of Every ship in the sea](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-every-ship-real-time/?fbclid=IwAR0siK8NBpaD0lG6hT7xCc1QIGtzaXot0w7bO64xs0ApWVTa8N7yPnP9ygs)

What technology is used to trace the ship?

There is one system called AIS (Automatic Identification System), which requires tracked ships to be equipped by a device emitting signal with information about the ship, its size, destination, etc etc. The type of ships mandated to equip such devices is described in SOLAS (Safety Of Life At Sea) convention. Advanced systems, such as X-band marine radars, are required to track other targets not equipping AIS transmitters.
