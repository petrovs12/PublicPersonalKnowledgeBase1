Same/similar to [[seed.Product Management.Design Document]]

Gained bad reputation as long to read and dicataing.
In a Lean or Hybrid model of development it's not dictating and set in stone.

It evolves as 
data about user testing and how design, development, and marketing are going, arrives.





Contains:

# Why are we pursuing this opportunity? ^why

# Scoped problem definition ^problem definition


# Success Metrics ^ metrics
