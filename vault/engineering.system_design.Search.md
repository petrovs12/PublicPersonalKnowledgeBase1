Three basic stages of search : 
__crawling__ â€“ where  discover pages; 
__indexing__ - normalize text from pages and make it easier to search
__retrieval -get a list of relevant search results.

# Crawling

Scan sites, get links, put in queue(#BFS), get content, images, etc, store in database. 
Maybe cache a copy of page


# Indexing

# Retrieval/Searching

 Ranking algorithm is trade secret, but we know about pagerank, etc.
