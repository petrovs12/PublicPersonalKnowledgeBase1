# THIS IS NOT STRICTLY About GAME THEORY




# Examples

## Epidemology

## Facebook Network Effect ^fbepidemology

Say we release a Facebook app feature that makes it more likely for ppl to post. Then people who interact with the app will have a higher chance of posting, but ALSO people who interact with people who post more will post more. Thus as we move out of the test and release the app, the number of people who post will increase via both the 'app-effect' itself, and via the number of interactions w/ people, posting more.
