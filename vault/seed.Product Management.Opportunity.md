# What is Opportunity Hypothesis ^hypothesis

## You have opinions, not facts

## 'Average' fallacy.
* People think they are 'average' in the sense they are the 'mode' of the distribution on a given topic. Therefore if they want something, many other people would want it too.


## Testing ideas
 Amazon tests all ideas, <50% of even very good 'first principle' ideas fail

What does it mean to __fail__? To not move the metrics you set out in the beginning in the desired direction.

* Have to figure out we're wrong __quickly__.
* An idea could be **good**, but not helpful for you or your customers.
* Businesses that start with the business plan and product development, rather than __validate__ their fundamental idea, tend to fail.
