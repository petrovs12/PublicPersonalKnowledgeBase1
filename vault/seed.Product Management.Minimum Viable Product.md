Definition: A Minimum Viable Product (MVP)  is the most minimally featured thing you can build that will address the [[seed.Product Management.Opportunity]] for most of the [[seed.Product Management.Target Customers]] .


MVP should be focused, very good at what it does, and not doing too  much!!!

Sometimes, First MVP should be very hacky, human powered and not
automated (e.g. solved-by-hand instances.)



# CNN example

Core functionality.

Hybrid mode- add a few key features to current product, and show that as a MVP( to the product).

Can work only on some limited isntances.
