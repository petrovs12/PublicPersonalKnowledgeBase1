3- sided marketplace

Merchants, eaters, drivers.

Eaters-drivers:
Balance supply-demand, use levers, such as dynamic pricing (duh).

# Dispatch type problems

Core engine that powers fulfillment. Core assignment (match drivers to deliveries).

High-level goal- fast and efficient deliveries. 


# Steps
## Balance Supply and Demand

## Route Planning



## Matching


So they first balance the marketplace in general, then decide on fulfillment routes, order batching, etc.
Then assign route sets to drivers, basically...

Is it real time. First, the supply-demand balance has a planning horizon of a week.

Continue to update predictions as we go.

# Actions
Pricing, messaging to drivers, incentives (pricing).

# Core Matching happens on the fly.
