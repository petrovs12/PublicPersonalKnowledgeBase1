# [Multiple Layer Stacking](https://pycaret.org/stack-models/)

Base models can be in a single layer or in _**multiple layers in which case the predictions from each preceding layer is passed to the next layer as an input until**_ it reaches meta-model where predictions from all the layers including base layer is used as an input to generate final prediction.
