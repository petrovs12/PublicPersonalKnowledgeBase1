# Proxy and Reverse Proxy
## Forward Proxy
 
 A proxy server sits in front of some client machines (e.g. you IPS may be a proxy?) and intercepts web requests.

 It then redirects the request to the internet and can do some processing on the response and the request.

 ### Example  usecase:

 Thus it can help w/ security and generally augment both the request and the response.



 ## Reverse Proxy 

 A reverse proxy is a proxy server that sits in front of some server and intercepts web requests.

 Example use case:

 1. Load balancing
