Size of folded DNA grows as $O(\sqrt{N})$ of the length of the sequence. Random walk argument. If angles are random, that would be the expected length

*Disulfide bridges* - bonds between 2 strands of DNA that are not complimentary.
2 C AA would come together to staple the protein anf fold it together..


Native folds- one configuration occurs very often. Stable configurations...



Thermodynamic hypothesis - not onlythe C proteins, but all AA's in the protein together determine it's native fold...

Why was alcohol interfering witht the thing finding it's correct fold,though??![](/assets/images/2022-07-30-21-23-18.png)

Like heat, alcohol breaks protein fold...


Different bonds hold different amount of energy, so counting bonds is not an acceptable way to estimate energy...



# PCR, Genome reading, etc


## PCR is doubleing a piDNA
